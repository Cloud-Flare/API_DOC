Removes resourse record specified by ``rr_id`` from a host. To
prevent accidental deletion of an RR, ``confirm`` parameter has to
be present.

Required args:

   ``rr_id``: resource record id as queried from server, integer.
   ``confirm``: confirmation bit, must be set to non-'' value to
   process.

Returns: 

   A JSON object with indication of either success or failure. In
   case of failure the response should contain a textual error
   description.

   Example of a successful invocation: ``{"meta": {"success": 1,
   "code": 200}}``

   Example of a failed invocation: ``{"meta": {"code": 404,
   "success": 0, "error": "RR Record not found"}}``
