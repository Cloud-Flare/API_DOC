DNS.com API Documentation

This document serves as an overview to the DNS.com DNS service API.
To attain access to use the API approval must be applied for and granted
by the administrators of the DNS.com DNS platform. More information
can be accessed either thru the website () or by emailing . After an
overview of this documentation the user should be able to understand the
concepts of how DNS.com manages zones and geographic RR data as well as
execute on these concepts to manage their account.




Technology Overview

To access the API special permission must be granted by the
administrators. Please contact DNS.com for this access, as well as
access to the sandbox.



The API uses a simple Query String request for all actions to be made
and will return a crafted JSON () formated data response.



For Testing and Integration Developers

The address to the sandbox location is . To interact with the sandbox
you must create your own account on it. The sandbox is an entire test
suite. DNS is on this IP and updates should be visible from the single
IP host just as if it were on our DNS.com Anycast network. Additionally
URL forward services are available for testing on port 8080.



A Note For Enterprise Users

Please be aware there is a variable replacement allowed. When records
are compiled the token %s is replaced with the domain name root zone.
For example if you create a group and add the domain example.com and
example2.com. Create a CNAME resource record for the root zone that
answers as www.%s, what will be generated for each of your domains
resembled below:



example.com   CNAME → www.example.com

example2.com CNAME → www.example2.com




Round Robin Support

To implement round robin hosting for your domain all that is required is
to create 2 RR records. The multiple RR's will cycle during serving thus
giving the effect of round robin.




URL Forward Support

To ensure we are always able to return a record for any host name
requested we require that if you want to use URL forwarding that a
hostname be defined for URL forwarding rules. URL forward rules will not
be allowed to co-exist for a host name with other resource record types.




Terminology

Operational Mode

Sometimes references as 'mode', can be values of: group, custom,
advanced.

Group is globally accessible, custom only by domainers, and advanced is
only by enterprise users.

Domain group

A method of grouping domains for easier management. In DNS.com you can
create a change to a group that will profile how all domains in it
behave.

Traffic Destination

Is a parking target for Domainer users. A traffic destination might be
NameDrive or Sedo or any other service configured within DNS.com.

Traffic Rule

Is the combination of a domain name, a country group (geographical
target) and the traffic destination.

Confirmation Bit

Any value that will evaluate to True to verify the intent of the action.

Resource Record (RR)

A resource records can be easily summed up by the complete zone being
requested in association with the record type (ex. MX, CNAME, A...) with
the answer.




Required Fields

AUTH_TOKEN - 28 Byte authorization token generated.

Example Request

<?php
$AUTH_TOKEN = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
$hostname = 'sandbox.DNS.com';
$cmd = 'getDomains';

$url = "http://${hostname}/api/${cmd}/?AUTH_TOKEN=${AUTH_TOKEN}";

$results = file_get_contents($url);

echo $results;
?>
